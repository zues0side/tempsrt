1
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:17,543
Ju-on: The curse of one who dies
in the grip of powerful rage.

2
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:22,316
It gathers and takes effect in
the places that person was alive.

3
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:27,088
Those who encounter it die,
and a new curse is born.

4
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,636
JU-ON: The Grudge

5
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:21,676
Rika

6
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:26,616
Social Welfare Center

7
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,397
I'm back.

8
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:48,531
Hello.

9
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:53,576
Write your name and the time
in here, please.

10
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,045
All right.

11
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,413
There.

12
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:04,751
Thanks.

13
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:09,460
Rika!

14
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,392
It's this.

15
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,366
What? By myself?

16
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,869
There's no one else around.

17
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:19,529
But...

18
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,905
Whose case is it?

19
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:29,343
I can't reach him.

20
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,249
He took the key and left,
and hasn't come back.

21
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:37,582
I'm just a volunteer...

22
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:40,887
That's all right.
You're used to this.

23
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,927
Mr Hirohashi...

24
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:44,528
Mr Goto's looking for you.

25
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,155
Goto?

26
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,797
Would you do it?

27
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:53,168
Just look in on her.

28
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:54,536
But...

29
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,973
I'll buy you dinner.

30
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,908
You don't have to...

31
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,594
Tokunaga

32
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,621
Hello?

33
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:35,571
Hello!

34
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:54,359
I'm from the Welfare Center...

35
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:07,738
May I come in?

36
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,866
Are you all right?!

37
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,785
You're Sachie, right?

38
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:34,683
I'm here to help out
in place of Mr Takahashi.

39
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,389
I'm Nishina Rika.

40
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,367
Come on...

41
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,666
Come here...

42
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:53,273
Sachie!

43
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:57,044
Who's that boy upstairs?!

44
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,951
Sachie!

45
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,103
He was shut in a closet!

46
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:24,141
You didn't say anything
about a child.

47
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,979
Yes. He's still upstairs.

48
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,086
Yes.

49
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:35,025
I told you, they aren't home yet!

50
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,062
Yes.

51
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,360
But...

52
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,427
Yes.

53
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,199
All right.

54
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,667
Yes.

55
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:08,754
There's no one home right now.
Please leave a message.

56
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:13,529
Hello? It's Hitomi.

57
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:18,160
Hello? Kazumi, are you there?

58
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,664
How's Mom getting along?

59
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:30,240
I'm a bit worried,
so please give me a call.

60
00:13:16,362 --> 00:13:19,195
Um, what's your name?

61
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:23,765
Toshio.

62
00:13:25,171 --> 00:13:27,765
Yeah? 'Toshio'...

63
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:31,336
My name's...

64
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,708
I told her.

65
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,624
Sachie?

66
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,266
I told her.

67
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,266
I told Kazumi.

68
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:02,730
I told her again and again.

69
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,768
I told her again and again.

70
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,144
What's the matter?

71
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:14,208
Why don't you lie down, OK?

72
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:18,354
Again and again, I told her.

73
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:22,883
Just the way you said to.

74
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:27,163
Please stop tormenting me.

75
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,695
Sachie...

76
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:15,637
Katsuya

77
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,003
Morning.

78
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,513
Mom sure sleeps late these days.

79
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,682
That's 'cause she's up all night.

80
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,946
Every night.

81
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:36,489
I'm sure it's fine for someone
who can sleep through anything.

82
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,468
Maybe it was the move.

83
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:54,708
I'll talk to the helper.
We're paying for him, after all.

84
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,246
That won't help. Your mother's
always nice with other people.

85
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:02,378
OK, OK. Try to get along, will you?

86
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,421
You'll be home early?

87
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,658
Your sister's coming!

88
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,532
You forgot!

89
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:17,157
Is it Friday already?

90
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,463
Get it together.

91
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,403
Hurry home.

92
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,606
OK. See you.

93
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,281
Oh, Mother!

94
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:08,451
Just tell me if you want something!

95
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,919
Who's that?

96
00:19:17,756 --> 00:19:19,587
Who's there?

97
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:11,040
I'm home!

98
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,648
Is Hitomi here?

99
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,083
Kazumi?

100
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,527
Mom?

101
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,802
Where's Kazumi?

102
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,141
Mom?

103
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,574
Where is she?!

104
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,610
Kazumi!

105
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,038
Kazumi?

106
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:28,283
Are you here?

107
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,064
Kazumi?

108
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:41,597
Kazumi!

109
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,025
Hey! Kazumi!

110
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,335
Kazumi!

111
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,334
Kazumi!

112
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,005
Hey! Kazumi!

113
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,840
What's wrong? What happened?

114
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:03,780
What?

115
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,720
Hang on. I'll call an ambulance.

116
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:51,721
What are you doing here?!

117
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:15,546
Kazumi!

118
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,856
Hello!

119
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,997
Hello? I'm here!

120
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,439
Kazumi?

121
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,805
Kazumi?

122
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,363
Hi, Mom. How are you?

123
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,840
Where's Kazumi?

124
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,879
I'll start getting dinner ready.

125
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,964
Kazumi? Is that you?

126
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,197
Katsuya?

127
00:27:04,189 --> 00:27:08,057
Don't scare me like that!

128
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,388
Where's Kazumi?

129
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:19,202
Kazumi went out. Something came up.

130
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:26,243
She's not shopping?
She'll be back soon, won't she?

131
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:38,078
I'm sorry, Hitomi.
This isn't a very good time.

132
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,221
What's going on?

133
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,894
Did something happen?

134
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:45,623
She had another man.

135
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:46,721
What?!

136
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:50,501
She deceived me!

137
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:55,268
That's not my child.
That's not my child.

138
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,774
What are you talking about?!

139
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,579
Look, just go away, OK?

140
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,451
Are you feeling all right?

141
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,617
I'm fine.
Just leave me alone for a while.

142
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:22,458
Hitomi

143
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:32,097
There's no one home right now.
Please leave a message.

144
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,630
Hello? It's Hitomi.

145
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:41,877
Hello? Kazumi, are you there?

146
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,783
How's Mom getting along?

147
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:53,487
I'm a bit worried,
so please give me a call.

148
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,885
Tokunaga Katsuya

149
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:05,391
Hello, Katsuya?
I just called your house.

150
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:09,958
Hello? Katsuya?

151
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:16,537
Look, this isn't funny!

152
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,748
Sorry. I just hung up.

153
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,218
Who's there?

154
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:02,014
The 5th-floor Ladies'?

155
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,244
Yes.

156
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,485
I'll go take a look.

157
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:09,952
You wait here.

158
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,437
Excuse me!

159
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,073
Yes?

160
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:13,804
Hello? It's me.

161
00:35:13,878 --> 00:35:15,038
Katsuya?

162
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:19,412
I'm out front of your building.
What number were you?

163
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:23,520
702! Hurry, will you?

164
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:41,996
Katsuya!

165
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:51,241
...also a house bat,
a pygmy woodpecker...

166
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:57,573
...wild birds not seen here before,
a blue-green snake...

167
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:03,550
...among 54 discoveries, including
a 2.5- Meter discarded snakeskin...

168
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:20,687
Toyama

169
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,217
Hello?

170
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,190
Hello?

171
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:01,932
Missus?

172
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,241
Missus?

173
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:28,892
Rika?

174
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,095
Rika?

175
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:40,276
Rika!

176
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,743
Rika!

177
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,765
Mr Nakagawa...

178
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,133
Dial him.

179
00:41:11,836 --> 00:41:13,497
Up there.

180
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,366
Rika...

181
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,601
Rika!

182
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,837
Are you OK?

183
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,845
Yeah. Sorry, Mariko.

184
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:59,576
You're missing school.

185
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,609
That's OK.
I've got all the credits I need.

186
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,814
Anyway, what happened?

187
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:14,891
I don't really understand
that myself.

188
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,927
Was Hirohashi bugging you
to do something again?

189
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,130
And you couldn't say no?

190
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:28,208
You're supposed to be
the care-giver!

191
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,841
I'm glad you came.

192
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,584
I'll go buy a drink.

193
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:50,330
So that was the first time
you'd been there?

194
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,869
Yes, it was.

195
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:58,898
About the child
you say you saw there...

196
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,278
Did you find him?

197
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,177
No... not yet.

198
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,948
'Toshio'...

199
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:20,625
He said his name was Toshio.

200
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:22,063
Toshio?

201
00:43:28,005 --> 00:43:33,966
Ms Nishina, the Tokunagas
don't have any children.

202
00:43:34,044 --> 00:43:35,409
What?

203
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:41,076
What about that photograph?

204
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:43,915
There was a family picture
in the house.

205
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:50,289
That wasn't the Tokunagas.

206
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:53,288
Then who was it?

207
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:57,092
We're looking into that.

208
00:44:00,704 --> 00:44:02,535
Detective...

209
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,602
What happened there?

210
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,417
Excuse me.

211
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:38,030
The families before the Tokunagas
all died or disappeared, too.

212
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,442
Is this all of them?

213
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:48,442
What about the sister?

214
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,011
We can't find her.

215
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:55,384
A security guard
where she works is dead, too.

216
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,560
And...

217
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,427
...look at this.

218
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:11,073
A man named Saeki Takeo
killed his wife Kayako there.

219
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:16,579
Later he was found dead
on the road by a neighbor.

220
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:24,350
Saeki Kayako, 28, housewife.

221
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:30,359
She and Takeo had a son.

222
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,432
'Toshio'...

223
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:55,313
Kayako's body was found...

224
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:01,819
...up there under the roof.

225
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,386
Hi, Daddy!

226
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,012
Hi, lzumi. Where's Mom?

227
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,317
Shopping.

228
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:35,717
She'll be angry again
if you don't get home.

229
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,852
It's OK. Come over here.

230
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,152
Why?

231
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,696
Come on!

232
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:42,494
Quick!

233
00:46:42,566 --> 00:46:44,158
What is it?

234
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:46,994
Look at this.

235
00:46:47,104 --> 00:46:49,368
Did you draw those?

236
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:50,599
Yep!

237
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:54,708
This is the Prince of Heaven.

238
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,637
That's the Princess.

239
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:02,241
And that's their baby.

240
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,752
Yeah? And who's this?

241
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,259
Mr Toyama Yuji? Lgarashi,
Yahara Division.

242
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,667
Ow!

243
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,672
What is it?

244
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:28,273
You were in charge of the
Saeki investigation.

245
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,913
I'd like to talk to you.

246
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:37,243
Izumi, you get on home.

247
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:54,295
I quit the force.
Leave me alone, will you?

248
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:58,237
Two more people have died there.

249
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,445
You're the only one left
who was involved with the case.

250
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,788
Izumi! What are you doing there?

251
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:22,864
Did you clean the bath?
It's your turn today, you know.

252
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:25,426
Get going.

253
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,735
Was this the boy you saw
at the Tokunaga house?

254
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,305
Yes.

255
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,283
Take a good look.

256
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:47,346
You're sure?

257
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:51,624
Yes, it was him. Did you find him?

258
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:52,855
No.

259
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:59,266
He went missing five years ago.
He's never been found.

260
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:06,634
Even if he were alive somewhere,
he'd be 11 years old.

261
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,890
Huh?

262
00:50:07,437 --> 00:50:08,927
Mr Nakagawa...

263
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,872
This is Toyama Yuji.

264
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,875
He was on that case.

265
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:17,012
Thank you.

266
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:24,446
My name's Nakagawa. Come in.

267
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:43,439
Tokunaga Hitomi. Her elder brother
Katsuya lived in that house.

268
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:46,601
She went home, then disappeared.

269
00:50:46,777 --> 00:50:50,008
Someone in her building
saw her come home.

270
00:50:58,121 --> 00:51:01,557
They found Hirohashi's body.

271
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:06,555
The man who found Rika is dead.

272
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:07,688
Mr. Toyama.

273
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,164
Would you excuse me a minute,
please?

274
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:47,115
Lzumi, you're chicken!

275
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,445
What's that?

276
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:50,644
Sake.

277
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,050
What's that doing here?

278
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:58,655
Saori, you pig!

279
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:02,593
That's not sake.

280
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,201
I'm leaving!

281
00:55:08,271 --> 00:55:10,637
Wait! It's OK!

282
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:11,833
Are you running out?

283
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:12,966
Lzumi!

284
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,756
What a suck!

285
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:37,992
She's always like that.

286
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:45,338
Yeah, and I heard...

287
00:55:45,408 --> 00:55:47,740
...now she hangs with Chiharu.

288
00:55:55,652 --> 00:56:00,112
He hasn't come home.
Where could he be?

289
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:05,726
Well? She's gone, you know.

290
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,763
Can you believe that!

291
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,265
Ayano, check out the window.

292
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,032
She's there.

293
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:18,333
She's by the gate.
It looks like she's thinking.

294
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,602
Why's she so scared?

295
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,201
Maybe she's got ESP.

296
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:26,281
She didn't have to leave!

297
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,707
I'm cold.

298
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,817
Yeah.

299
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:33,113
What was that?

300
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,053
What's wrong?

301
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:36,058
Lzumi's gone!

302
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:39,690
What?

303
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:18,191
Mr Toyama!

304
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:20,999
Mr Nakagawa!

305
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:22,833
Mr Toyama!

306
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,897
Please!

307
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:26,839
Get a grip!

308
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,002
What happened?!

309
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:03,177
Lzumi

310
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:05,414
What's 1 st period?

311
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,847
English?

312
00:58:06,916 --> 00:58:08,781
Mr Sekine!

313
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:10,211
Oh, yuck!

314
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,081
His English is weird!

315
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,122
Yeah!

316
00:58:13,189 --> 00:58:15,851
It doesn't sound like
any English I've heard.

317
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,325
Do foreigners understand him?

318
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,828
He probably can't speak it!

319
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:25,865
Yeah, but he's teaching it to us!

320
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:29,996
Lzumi?

321
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,273
Lzumi?

322
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,410
What's wrong?

323
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:37,571
Nothing.

324
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:42,212
Missing

325
00:58:48,892 --> 00:58:50,826
Isn't she lzumi?

326
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:52,885
She is not.

327
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:55,897
Find one?

328
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,125
Not yet.

329
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:17,077
'Bye.

330
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:20,313
Mr Sekine!

331
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,056
What's up?

332
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:26,357
Toyama? What's wrong?

333
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:31,430
There's no picture of lzumi.

334
00:59:31,501 --> 00:59:33,059
Why not?

335
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:36,235
That shouldn't be. Did you look?

336
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,364
There isn't.

337
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,806
We looked and looked and looked!

338
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:40,900
I see.

339
00:59:41,444 --> 00:59:45,073
OK, I'll check the negatives.
Can you wait a while?

340
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:47,314
'Bye.

341
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,313
How long?!

342
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:52,411
Don't pull!
You'll stretch my sweater!

343
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:54,046
Within a week.

344
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:55,954
Why a week?!

345
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:57,515
I'm a busy man!

346
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:34,229
A woman's body has been found
in an empty house in Nerima ward.

347
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:39,127
Nishina Rika,
a 23 year-old social worker...

348
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:43,935
...had been listed as missing.
No marks were found on the body.

349
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:54,202
Thank you.

350
01:01:57,747 --> 01:01:59,544
Finally!

351
01:01:59,615 --> 01:02:01,549
It's not my fault!

352
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:04,347
We're going to lzumi's.

353
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,321
OK, I'll come with you.

354
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,220
Hey!

355
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:09,690
No, thanks. 'Bye.

356
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,989
We'll bring them back tomorrow.

357
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,120
Talk to Toyama for me!

358
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,122
Let me see!

359
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:17,257
No!

360
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:19,062
We'll see them with lzumi.

361
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,501
But I want to see them!

362
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:40,681
You're lzumi's friends?

363
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:50,599
Lzumi? It's Chiharu and Miyuki.

364
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:54,197
We brought the pictures.

365
01:03:05,381 --> 01:03:08,077
Can we come in?

366
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:32,568
Isn't it a bit dark in here?

367
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:36,910
Don't!

368
01:03:58,301 --> 01:03:59,598
Lzumi?

369
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:02,303
What's wrong?

370
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:05,766
Lzumi?

371
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:13,445
The three of them are looking in...

372
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:17,476
...at me.

373
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:24,359
'The three of them'?

374
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,160
Saori and the rest.

375
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:36,499
The night they disappeared,
I was with them.

376
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,766
Then why didn't...

377
01:04:40,843 --> 01:04:42,174
I was scared!

378
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:48,480
Scared of what?

379
01:04:53,422 --> 01:04:56,619
When we came back
from the school trip...

380
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,457
...Saori said...

381
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,360
...there was a haunted house
near here.

382
01:05:07,436 --> 01:05:09,370
Haunted?

383
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,806
Where?

384
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:17,712
I forget!

385
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:19,974
How could you forget?

386
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:21,346
I wanted to!

387
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:25,350
Lzumi,
will you tell us what's going on?

388
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,656
Even before we went in...

389
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:38,963
...I felt something strange.

390
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:48,803
Izumi, do you have ESP or something?

391
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,175
I don't.

392
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,373
It's not that.

393
01:05:52,481 --> 01:05:54,847
You guys keep away.

394
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:04,984
Saori and the others treated it as
a joke, but I couldn't stay there.

395
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:09,558
I left, by myself.

396
01:06:13,302 --> 01:06:15,930
I was scared. I ran away.

397
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:20,372
They're coming for me!

398
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:24,402
Lzumi, chill out!

399
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:29,916
Close the curtains!

400
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:31,444
Close them!

401
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:33,549
Close them!!

402
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:51,603
That's what my husband was like
before he died.

403
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:57,345
He had all the windows
closed tight...

404
01:06:58,948 --> 01:07:03,009
Does lzumi know about that?

405
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:10,853
I never told her anything about it.

406
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:31,469
The pictures...

407
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:51,363
What's that?

408
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,423
Chiharu!

409
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:59,159
Who are you?

410
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:08,699
Dad?

411
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:32,695
I saw you at that house, you know.

412
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:17,998
Kayako

413
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:26,301
Hello?

414
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:30,043
Mariko! It's been ages!

415
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,715
Yeah. What's up?

416
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,211
Yeah.

417
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:40,954
Wow, that must have been hard.

418
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,916
Peek-a-boo!

419
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:49,659
Peek-a-boo!

420
01:12:57,106 --> 01:13:00,701
Tomorrow? Yeah, I'm OK.

421
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,305
Yeah, OK.

422
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,738
OK, see you.

423
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:14,722
I'm coming, Mr Saito.

424
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:21,052
I hear you're going to be
a great-grandfather!

425
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:24,331
Peek-a-boo!

426
01:13:29,772 --> 01:13:31,103
Mr Saito?

427
01:13:40,215 --> 01:13:41,375
Thank you.

428
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:30,788
Rika!

429
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:33,866
Mariko!

430
01:14:34,503 --> 01:14:37,301
How have you been?
You've changed your hair.

431
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:38,771
I got it cut.

432
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,268
Are you free Sunday?

433
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:44,443
Sunday? Sure.

434
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:45,343
Yeah?

435
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:48,909
He gave me two tickets...

436
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:50,914
...and said to take you.

437
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:52,248
Really?

438
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,586
What?

439
01:14:57,292 --> 01:15:01,695
In third year you liked Toyoshima,
didn't you.

440
01:15:01,797 --> 01:15:02,991
Huh?

441
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:07,232
It was all over your face.

442
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:27,183
There's already one problem kid...

443
01:15:27,256 --> 01:15:29,554
in my new class.

444
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:32,258
He hasn't come to school once!

445
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:33,987
And his parents?

446
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:37,327
That's the problem.
I can't contact them.

447
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:41,267
Well,
there must be some kind of reason...

448
01:15:41,336 --> 01:15:44,305
At least they could return my calls.

449
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:46,534
I want to finish my home visits!

450
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:49,577
Oh, yeah... home visits...

451
01:15:49,645 --> 01:15:53,706
All the other teachers
have finished theirs.

452
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:54,543
That's funny.

453
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:55,480
What is?

454
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,513
You're turned into a real teacher.

455
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,953
What about you?

456
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:08,056
I wonder about that.
I don't really understand...

457
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:10,398
What?

458
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,528
I thought I felt...

459
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:18,364
Rika? Are you OK

460
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,338
Rika!

461
01:16:23,445 --> 01:16:26,903
Rika, what's wrong?! Are you OK?

462
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,046
Uh, yeah...

463
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:44,916
Hello, Nishima.

464
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,487
Rika?

465
01:18:46,555 --> 01:18:50,548
Mariko? I'm sorry about today.

466
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:55,326
You scared me! Are you all right now?

467
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:59,125
Yeah. Thanks for asking.

468
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:02,759
I'm sorry I ruined your day off.

469
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:05,366
No, I'm OK.

470
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:08,072
Where are you now?

471
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:11,078
Remember that kid I told you about?

472
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:14,115
I'm at his house now.

473
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:15,610
Yeah...

474
01:19:15,684 --> 01:19:19,814
There's no one here but the boy.
His parents haven't come home.

475
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:22,788
I've been here for an hour.

476
01:19:29,131 --> 01:19:32,794
Mariko, where exactly are you?

477
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,203
Hello?

478
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,279
Hello, Rika?

479
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:52,119
Hello?

480
01:19:54,089 --> 01:19:56,182
Hey. Rika!

481
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,328
Toshio?

482
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:09,296
Toshio?

483
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,868
Toshio?

484
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:18,773
Toshio?

485
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:26,120
Are you up here?

486
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:48,766
Mariko!

487
01:21:18,173 --> 01:21:19,902
Mariko...

488
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:57,871
Mariko?

489
01:22:38,386 --> 01:22:39,978
Mariko?

490
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:03,801
No!

491
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:09,842
No!

492
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:12,903
No!

493
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:12,782
No!
