00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:07.707
Juon - A curse born of a strong grudge held by someone
who died.

2
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:11.380
The place of his death gathers his grudge.

3
00:00:11.413 --> 00:00:16.052
Anyone who comes into contact with this curse shall lose
his life and a new curse is born.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:02.856

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:01.314
Just a few minutes.

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.678
What's wrong?

12
00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.682
Is there a problem?

13
00:03:35.682 --> 00:03:39.686
Are you done with visiting students' homes?

14
00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:43.690
One more family to go.
Their kid hasn't been coming to school.

15
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.292
Have you contacted his parents?

16
00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:47.727
No.

17
00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:50.597
Can't you get in touch with them?

18
00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:54.601
No, I can't.

19
00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:57.737
Being a teacher is tough work, huh?

20
00:03:57.737 --> 00:04:01.675
Yes, it is.

Mr. Kobayashi.

23
00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:40.747
Hey, do you remember a girl from college named Kawamata?

24
00:04:40.747 --> 00:04:45.618
Kawamata? Kayoko Kawamata?

25
00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:51.458
-She was...
-Kind of Creepy girl, wasn't she?

26
00:04:51.458 --> 00:04:55.362
-What's wrong, all of a sudden?
-Oh no, nothing.

27
00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:58.264
Strange.

28
00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:04.104
-Is it all right to eat this much?
-Of course, it's ok.

29
00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:32.459
Hello?

30
00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:36.463
Anybody home?

31
00:07:27.781 --> 00:07:30.250
Toshio?

32
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.620
Oh, you are home.

33
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.624
Mr. Koooobaaaayaaaashiiii...

34
00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:51.438
I am here today, because you never go to school.
Everybody has been worrying about you.

35
00:08:00.547 --> 00:08:05.018
Toshio... Isn't your mother home?

36
00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:16.262
Toshio!

37
00:08:24.037 --> 00:08:27.807
Hello?

38
00:08:27.807 --> 00:08:31.811
Hello?

39
00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.649
I am coming in now.

40
00:08:39.719 --> 00:08:42.355
Toshio?

41
00:08:42.255 --> 00:08:43.523
Toshio?

42
00:08:43.523 --> 00:08:46.059
Toshio!

43
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.780
What's wrong?

44
00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.327
Are you okay?

45
00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.664
Can I check you?

46
00:09:32.205 --> 00:09:35.342
No Fever....

47
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.753
I know...

48
00:09:46.753 --> 00:09:50.757
Toshio, Do you remember your drawing?

49
00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:01.301
Here it is.

50
00:10:02.736 --> 00:10:07.073
You drew the picture very well.
The other teachers thought so, too.

51
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:14.214
Is you mother out shopping?

52
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:17.417
Together.

53
00:10:17.384 --> 00:10:22.355
Together? Your mother went out with your father?

54
00:10:22.555 --> 00:10:25.625
-Yeah.
-I see.

55
00:10:27.727 --> 00:10:31.064
What were you doing in the bathroom?

56
00:11:39.065 --> 00:11:45.038
Yuki

57
00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:15.568
Yes.

58
00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:21.741
Sorry to bug you.  I am going out for a little while, so here's a snack for when you take a break.

59
00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:25.078
Thank you.

60
00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.284
-The cat is back.
-There are a lot of cats around here.

61
00:12:31.284 --> 00:12:35.288
I wonder if it's the same cat that came a few days ago?

62
00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:40.326
It is ok, Yuki.  I will chase them away.

63
00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:46.666
-Thank you.
-Kanna please do your best to learn.
Yuki, I leave Kanna in your hands.

64
00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:49.502
Hurry up and leave!

65
00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.440
I will be back early, so Yuki why don't you eat with us.

66
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.108
Thank you.

67
00:12:55.108 --> 00:12:58.278
-You are so noisy!
-Ok. Ok.

68
00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:06.419
Let's begin.

69
00:13:11.424 --> 00:13:15.228
Let's begin now.

70
00:13:44.257 --> 00:13:47.627
Say, is there one?

71
00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:52.165
-One what?
-You know, a boyfriend?

72
00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:55.402
We don't have to talk about that right now.

73
00:13:55.435 --> 00:13:58.238
ome on, tell me.

74
00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:04.210
No way... We will study until here and then we will take a break.

75
00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:08.214
Then can we talk about your boyfriend?

76
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.053
OK.

77
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.656
Promise me.

78
00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:19.526
It's a promise.

79
00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:42.615
, tell me about him.

80
00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:48.154
-What are you talking about?
-You are so sly.  You promised me.

81
00:14:51.157 --> 00:14:56.329
-Wait a minute.
-No. It's not that. Don't you hear it a little?

82
00:14:57.197 --> 00:15:00.266
-What is that noise?
-Darn you, you promised.

83
00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:04.270
No!  You can't really hear that?

84
00:15:08.308 --> 00:15:13.780
Ok, I will tell you. I don't have a boyfriend now.

85
00:15:16.116 --> 00:15:19.586
-Serious?
-It's true.

86
00:15:19.753 --> 00:15:24.124
-That's no good.
-I really don't have a boyfriend.

87
00:15:24.124 --> 00:15:27.394
right, what about your ex-boyfriend?

88
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.163
Wait. Be quiet.

89
00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:33.767
You don't hear that sound?

90
00:15:34.801 --> 00:15:36.803
What is it?

91
00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:39.673
That is a strange sound.

92
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.680
I don't hear it.

93
00:15:48.815 --> 00:15:51.618
It is just me?

94
00:15:54.788 --> 00:15:57.257
It's a cat!

95
00:15:57.257 --> 00:16:00.060
Knock it off!

96
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:14.474
-What?
-What time is now? I have to go to school today.

97
00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:18.211
-What? Go to School?
-I have to feed the rabbit.

98
00:16:18.211 --> 00:16:22.215
Rabbit? How can you forget something like that?

99
00:16:29.723 --> 00:16:33.526
-Miiiizuuuhoooo.
-Kanna!

100
00:16:33.526 --> 00:16:37.030
What?  What? What? What?

101
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:41.368
e's got a girlfriend.

102
00:16:41.368 --> 00:16:45.238
Tsuyoshi?  Have you met her yet?

103
00:16:45.238 --> 00:16:48.575
-He only brought her home once.
-Really.  What kind of girl is she?

104
00:16:48.575 --> 00:16:50.610
She is cute.

105
00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:53.613
Hey!  Quit talking about my girlfriend!

106
00:16:56.082 --> 00:16:57.617

109
00:17:09.229 --> 00:17:11.331
Tsuyoshi!

110
00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:14.734
-What?
-Do you have a picture of your girlfriend?

111
00:17:14.734 --> 00:17:17.170
No.

112
00:21:59.119 --> 00:22:04.758
Mizuho

113
00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.008
Tsuyoshi!

114
00:20:08.008 --> 00:20:10.076
Tsuyoshi!

115
00:22:15.268 --> 00:22:17.270
Tsuyoshi!

116
00:22:28.381 --> 00:22:30.083
Tsuyoshi!

117
00:23:04.084 --> 00:23:06.152
Oh, Tezuka.

118
00:23:06.152 --> 00:23:08.421
Did you come with Tsuyoshi?

119
00:23:08.421 --> 00:23:12.425
Huh, no I didn't.  But his bike is over there.

120
00:23:12.425 --> 00:23:14.761
yeah. I know.

121
00:23:14.761 --> 00:23:18.164
He is probably still inside of school.

122
00:23:19.432 --> 00:23:24.270
-Did you call him? Did you get a hold of him?
-No.  Yesterday, Mr. Nakumuea took his cell phone.

123
00:23:24.337 --> 00:23:26.806
Damn.

124
00:23:27.173 --> 00:23:31.344
-Is that it?
-Yeah, I found it over there.

125
00:23:32.345 --> 00:23:36.249
I wonder if he came with someone?

126
00:23:36.383 --> 00:23:39.419
Well if you wait for him, you will see him.  Later.

127
00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:42.722
Wait a minute. Please help me look for him.

128
00:23:55.602 --> 00:23:58.538
Hey!

129
00:23:58.538 --> 00:24:03.510
What are you doing? I am locking up the school so hurry up and go home.

130
00:24:04.244 --> 00:24:07.080
But um I am waiting for my friend.

131
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:10.216
Friend? What are you talking about?

132
00:24:10.216 --> 00:24:14.754
here is nobody inside. I just checked.

133
00:24:15.021 --> 00:24:17.490
But um...

134
00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.393
But his bike is over there and uh that is also his bag.

135
00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:24.364
He is probably still here.

136
00:24:24.364 --> 00:24:26.700
What is your class and name?

137
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.769
-huh?
-Your class and name?

138
00:24:29.769 --> 00:24:33.239
I am in the 2nd year 4th class.  My name is Tamura Mizuho.

139
00:24:33.239 --> 00:24:35.675
Come to the teacher's room.

140
00:24:35.675 --> 00:24:37.243
OK.

141
00:24:47.487 --> 00:24:50.557
What are you doing?

142
00:24:50.557 --> 00:24:53.560
Who is your teacher?

143
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.329
I am going to tell your teacher about this.

144
00:24:57.497 --> 00:24:59.666

2nd year 4 class Tsuyoshi Murakami.

00:25:19.352 --> 00:25:23.423

148
00:25:23.723 --> 00:25:28.361
I repeat, 2nd year 4th class Murakami.

149
00:25:28.361 --> 00:25:31.398
2nd year 4th class Tsuyoshi Murakami.

150
00:25:31.398 --> 00:25:35.535
Please come to the teacher's room.

151
00:25:39.806 --> 00:25:43.410
Well, I check inside of the school again.

152
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.812
You should wait here.

153
00:25:50.083 --> 00:25:54.788
If he comes here, don't go home until I get back.

154
00:25:54.788 --> 00:25:58.358
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

155
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.212
Hello.. This is Tamura.... I wonder if Tsuyoshi had come back home.

156
00:26:53.446 --> 00:26:56.449
Yes.

157
00:27:02.555 --> 00:27:05.191
I see.

158
00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:07.594
I know the number.

159
00:27:07.594 --> 00:27:09.596
I understa.. huh?

160
00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:13.600
Yes.

161
00:27:39.793 --> 00:27:42.195
Hello?

162
00:27:43.329 --> 00:27:45.465
Hello?

163
00:27:51.438 --> 00:27:54.507
Are you still there?

164
00:27:56.042 --> 00:27:58.511
Hello?

165
00:31:29.055 --> 00:31:31.658
Hello?

166
00:32:00.653 --> 00:32:06.459
Kanna

167
00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.273
Doctor, you found something?

168
00:32:21.174 --> 00:32:26.413
There was a dead rabbit's body mixed in the body's blood and tissues.

169
00:32:26.413 --> 00:32:30.150
Yes, I saw it at the scene.  Anything else?

170
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.285
There are no signs that anybody else had a hand in this.

171
00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:39.225
The body appears to have been twisted and broken.

172
00:32:43.163 --> 00:32:45.632
What is that?

173
00:32:45.632 --> 00:32:50.103
It was found in the dismembered body.

174
00:32:58.211 --> 00:33:00.213
A jaw?

175
00:33:00.213 --> 00:33:05.285
Yes. It is a human's jaw.

176
00:33:11.424 --> 00:33:14.728
It is somebody else's.

177
00:33:14.728 --> 00:33:18.732
There was another person at the scene?

178
00:33:19.299 --> 00:33:21.501
Perhaps.

179
00:33:21.501 --> 00:33:26.172
They didn't find the body that the jaw was from.

180
00:33:26.172 --> 00:33:31.378
We have sent samples to the lab to try to match the DNA.

181
00:33:31.378 --> 00:33:34.214
The body missing the jaw is gone.

182
00:33:34.214 --> 00:33:38.218
What is the cause of death of this person?

183
00:33:38.218 --> 00:33:42.789
Actually, I don't understand that very well.

184
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:49.829
The body is so badly broken and twisted we can't say the cause of death was heart failure.

185
00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:57.437
This is my first time seeing a body like this.

186
00:33:58.772 --> 00:34:00.674
Excuse me. Excuse me.

187
00:34:00.674 --> 00:34:07.013
We talked to the teacher who is a witness and it appears a little after 2 pm...

188
00:34:07.013 --> 00:34:11.651
...the two third year girls went to the middle school to feed the rabbits.

189
00:34:11.651 --> 00:34:15.655
This is Hisae Yoshia and this is Kanna Murakami.

190
00:34:38.144 --> 00:34:40.680
-Say, Kamio.
-Yes.

191
00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:49.055
Is it possible for a person who lost a jaw like
that to still be alive? What do you think?

192
00:34:52.325 --> 00:34:55.395
Impossible.

193
00:35:20.053 --> 00:35:23.289
I am home.

194
00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:28.261
Wrong address again.

195
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:36.736
Kanna! I got ice cream, do you want some?

196
00:35:43.543 --> 00:35:50.116
Hello, this is Murakami. Ok, please wait a minute.

197
00:35:50.116 --> 00:35:53.319
Tsuyoshi!

198
00:35:53.319 --> 00:35:55.588
Tsuyoshi!

199
00:35:57.323 --> 00:35:59.726
Tsyoshi!

200
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.298
Kanna!

201
00:36:05.298 --> 00:36:08.335
Where is Tsuyoshi?

202
00:36:27.654 --> 00:36:31.424
Hello.  He hasn't came back home yet.

203
00:36:32.058 --> 00:36:35.428
Perhaps he is still on his way here.

204
00:36:36.062 --> 00:36:38.732
Do you know his cell number?

205
00:36:38.732 --> 00:36:42.736
Why don't call his cell phone?

206
00:36:43.336 --> 00:36:46.740
Just a minute, it looks like he just got back.

207
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.410
Tsuyoshi?  Are you back?

208
00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:53.480
ou have a phone call.

209
00:37:08.061 --> 00:37:11.197
Kanna?

210
00:37:15.568 --> 00:37:18.204
Kanna?

211
00:37:18.204 --> 00:37:20.240
You?

212
00:37:49.703 --> 00:37:52.439
Who are you?

213
00:38:32.746 --> 00:38:40.920
ayako

214
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:07.681
es. Yes. Yes.

215
00:39:08.348 --> 00:39:10.750
No.  I will be late.

216
00:39:12.419 --> 00:39:16.423
That is right.

217
00:39:16.423 --> 00:39:24.264
His parents still haven't came back yet.
The child?   He is sleeping?

218
00:39:25.265 --> 00:39:28.668
Yes. Somebody came.

219
00:39:29.436 --> 00:39:35.075
Yes.  I will call you later.  OK.

220
00:41:51.411 --> 00:41:53.646
Toshio.

221
00:41:53.646 --> 00:41:56.249
Toshio.

222
00:41:56.616 --> 00:41:59.452
Toshio.

223
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.192
Toshio.

224
00:42:12.465 --> 00:42:14.067
Toshio.

225
00:42:22.676 --> 00:42:24.010
Toshio.

226
00:42:33.553 --> 00:42:38.291
-Mother, did I do good?
-Toshio!
-You did good. Really good.

227
00:42:41.594 --> 00:42:44.497
Mother, Where Are you going?

228
00:42:44.497 --> 00:42:48.501
My teacher is here.

229
00:42:48.501 --> 00:42:50.503
I see.

230
00:42:50.503 --> 00:42:54.741
Teacher said that he came to meet you,  Mother.

231
00:43:23.269 --> 00:43:25.271
Toshio!

232
00:43:25.271 --> 00:43:27.640
Its true.  Father and I.

233
00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.043
I am opening the door.

234
00:43:38.218 --> 00:43:40.520
Toshio.

235
00:44:06.246 --> 00:44:11.284
Toshio, were you talking to somebody?

236
00:44:18.191 --> 00:44:21.428
Your parents are late, aren't they?

237
00:44:21.594 --> 00:44:24.464
Kobayashi

238
00:47:08.461 --> 00:47:12.232
Today, I had eyes with Kobayashi.

239
00:47:12.232 --> 00:47:15.735
My heart began to fill and beat rapidly.

240
00:47:15.735 --> 00:47:19.172
Thoughts of him are inside of my head.
Kobayashi today again...

241
00:47:19.205 --> 00:47:21.775
And then he read manga while standing

242
00:47:21.775 --> 00:47:25.779
Kobayashi didn't come to school today...
Kobayashi often reads while standing

243
00:47:26.613 --> 00:47:29.349
Every week ...
But tomorrow, Kobayashi will certainly get better

244
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:33.353
Every night ...
That girl is acting too familiar with Kobayashi and is following my Kobayashi

245
00:47:33.353 --> 00:47:37.357
She is always with my Kobayashi
I worry about Kobayashi because has a weakness for alcohol

246
00:17:09.996 --> 00:17:14.000
and he always drinks to much
Kobayashi threw up along the road.

247
00:47:41.361 --> 00:47:45.365
but because I am better than that woman

248
00:47:45.365 --> 00:47:49.369
Because I know where Kobayashi lives

249
00:47:49.369 --> 00:47:53.373
In Kobayashi's room,  probably his favorites are...

250
00:47:54.474 --> 00:47:57.644
I took drunk Kobayashi to his apartment.  I went to his apartment many times

251
00:47:57.644 --> 00:48:01.614
The two of us rode a taxi.  Kobayashi drank too much sake

252
00:48:02.082 --> 00:48:04.684
Sleeping Kobayashi...
Painful Kobayashi...

253
00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.083
Toshio!  Toshio!

254
00:49:43.249 --> 00:49:46.052
Lets not stay here.

255
00:49:57.097 --> 00:49:59.532
Wait here.

256
00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:09.476
Tsuyoshi, let's go!

257
00:50:15.048 --> 00:50:18.118
Hello.

258
00:50:18.118 --> 00:50:22.122
So this is Mr Kobayashi.

259
00:50:24.257 --> 00:50:28.762
I am Saeki.  Tokeo Saeki.

260
00:50:29.529 --> 00:50:33.533
I'm Kayako's husband.

261
00:50:35.502 --> 00:50:39.439
Have you met with Kayako?

262
00:50:41.374 --> 00:50:46.513
After today, please take care of Toshio.

263
00:50:46.513 --> 00:50:48.782
What are you saying?

264
00:50:50.321 --> 00:50:57.590
I took care of Toshio instead of you,
now take your turn.

265
00:50:55.188 --> 00:50:57.457
Lets take turns.

266
00:50:57.457 --> 00:51:01.394
Instead of me?  Take turns?

267
00:51:06.066 --> 00:51:11.404
Oh, Mr Kobayashi, your baby was born.

268
00:51:13.273 --> 00:51:16.309
Born?

269
00:51:26.453 --> 00:51:29.689
You baby is here, it's a girl.

270
00:52:07.427 --> 00:52:10.597
Hello, mother?

271
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:19.105
Yes. Yes. I understand.

272
00:54:10.316 --> 00:54:13.153
Kobayashi.

273
00:55:50.483 --> 00:55:56.656
Kyoko

274
00:56:12.605 --> 00:56:17.610
-Good afternoon.
-Good Afternoon.  You are busy as usual.

275
00:56:17.711 --> 00:56:21.614
No No.  Please sit.

276
00:56:27.687 --> 00:56:31.257
-I am leaving.
-Okay, see you Later.

277
00:56:37.731 --> 00:56:41.735
Keiko, you done with work?

278
00:56:41.735 --> 00:56:44.537
Yes.

279
00:56:44.537 --> 00:56:47.307
How about a little bit?

280
00:56:47.307 --> 00:56:50.610
-What's wrong?
-Thank you, but no thank you.

281
00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:55.448
Nobuyuki is probably waiting at home.
You are the only one for your son.

282
00:56:55.448 --> 00:56:59.452
Ok. Ok. Ok.  I understand.

283
00:57:09.095 --> 00:57:12.298
What was that?  You said you wanted to talk?

284
00:57:12.365 --> 00:57:16.736
Yea,  Sis, I would like you to see one house.

285
00:57:16.736 --> 00:57:20.740
-You want me to look?
-Yea, just one house that is for sale.

286
00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:24.744
t won't be unpleasant.

287
00:57:24.744 --> 00:57:29.516
-What do you mean?
-Yea, we have one house now.

288
00:57:29.516 --> 00:57:31.751
The house has had a past.

289
00:57:31.751 --> 00:57:34.120
A past?

290
00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:40.093
Previously there was a family who live there.
They died and their bodies became missing.

291
00:57:42.462 --> 00:57:46.700
Well the way I look at it, it will be okay
for me if somebody buys it sooner.

292
00:57:46.633 --> 00:57:52.472
But nobody has bought it, yet.
I think having an exorcism is a little excessive, though.

293
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:57.344
I am afraid that will scare more people off.

294
00:57:59.079 --> 00:58:02.048
Sis, I want your unique opinion and insight.

295
00:58:02.048 --> 00:58:06.052
My opinion.  You want me to do it today?

296
00:58:06.052 --> 00:58:10.056
Well just a little, it is only looking around the house.

297
00:58:11.725 --> 00:58:14.194
It was a complete failure.

298
00:58:14.194 --> 00:58:20.200
Well originally we got the house cheap because of
the incident.  It is a nice house.

299
00:58:20.233 --> 00:58:25.071
It is still pretty.  I don't know where people
heard about the house and the incident.

300
00:58:25.071 --> 00:58:28.708
There is even a rumor about the house on the Internet.

301
00:58:28.708 --> 00:58:32.712
I am surprised that you are worried about that,
because normally this kind of stuff doesn't affect you.

302
00:58:32.712 --> 00:58:39.119
I am being a little superstitious.
If we can't sell the house we will lose money.

303
00:58:39.786 --> 00:58:43.723
I have to pay Shinobu alimony.

304
00:58:46.259 --> 00:58:49.496
It is nice and quiet around here.

305
00:58:50.196 --> 00:58:53.500
Here it is.

306
00:59:18.224 --> 00:59:21.294
Hey, what's wrong?

307
00:59:33.473 --> 00:59:35.475
After the deaths the police investigated,
and left everything inside the house.

308
00:59:37.344 --> 00:59:41.348
I hope the buyers will buy the house with
everything left inside of it.

309
00:59:53.526 --> 00:59:57.163
Hey, you are already feel something?

310
00:59:58.264 --> 01:00:01.434
The incident that was here, you said Murashimi?

311
01:00:01.434 --> 01:00:04.571
Yea.  Well the father is alive.

312
01:00:04.571 --> 01:00:08.575
There was only one person left?  Where is he now?

313
01:00:08.575 --> 01:00:11.511
According to the police statements, he is in the hospital.

314
01:00:11.511 --> 01:00:15.515
-I see.
-His wife and her daughter died at the same time.

315
01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:22.756
That's wrong! There wasn't only two people that died here!

316
01:00:24.491 --> 01:00:28.628
-What?
-I don't understand this very well.

317
01:00:28.628 --> 01:00:32.632
Well. Go inside.

318
01:00:51.384 --> 01:00:54.721
Saeki.  Who is this person?

319
01:00:55.455 --> 01:00:56.122
They lived here before Murakumi did.

320
01:00:58.658 --> 01:01:02.328
As I say the cheap things left here comes with trouble.

321
01:01:02.328 --> 01:01:10.136
It is quiet around here, and the station
is also close so I thought I could sell this place.

322
01:01:54.647 --> 01:01:58.084
Kyoko.

323
01:02:12.599 --> 01:02:16.536
This house... It's too much for me.

324
01:02:16.536 --> 01:02:20.540
Wait a minute!

325
01:02:24.044 --> 01:02:26.746
Is there sake here now?

326
01:02:26.746 --> 01:02:30.750
-Japanese Sake?
-Bring it!

327
01:03:03.316 --> 01:03:06.619
Is this OK?

328
01:03:31.411 --> 01:03:35.482
Promise me you will do what
I what I say from now.  OK?

329
01:03:36.383 --> 01:03:39.486
-What are you saying?
-OK?!

330
01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.222
Yes.

331
01:03:42.222 --> 01:03:46.726
Before somebody buys this house,
make them drink this sake.

332
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.063
-Huh?
-Promise me!

333
01:03:50.663 --> 01:03:58.471
If the customer says that sake isn't any good
or spits it out, never sell the house to them.

334
01:03:58.805 --> 01:04:01.174
What a minute.  What are you saying?

335
01:04:01.174 --> 01:04:06.144
Sake reacts naturally to the presents of spirits.

336
01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:09.616
During ancient times it was often used to
bless everything on ceremony alters.

337
01:04:09.616 --> 01:04:15.221
-OK.
-A person will be able to taste a difference
in sake that has been touched by spirits.

338
01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:23.162
So if a person who drinks the sake and the taste is
strange, the house is too dangerous for that person.

339
01:04:23.196 --> 01:04:25.298
Ok.

340
01:04:25.298 --> 01:04:31.736
Leave the sake in this room for a long time.  Promise before
somebody buys this house you will make them drink this sake.

341
01:04:32.672 --> 01:04:36.576
-I have to go!
-Hey, Kyoko!

342
01:04:41.348 --> 01:04:45.518
-Kyoko!
-I am sorry. I need to leave this house as soon as possible.

343
01:05:12.145 --> 01:05:16.149
What?  You sold the house?

344
01:05:16.149 --> 01:05:18.218
Why didn't you call me before you sold the house?

345
01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:24.320
Is that so?

346
01:05:25.225 --> 01:05:28.695
Did you do what I asked you to do?

347
01:05:29.362 --> 01:05:32.332
Yea, the sake.

348
01:05:33.066 --> 01:05:36.469
Yes, it was okay.  They tried to drink it.

349
01:05:37.537 --> 01:05:41.041
They were ok when they drank it.

350
01:05:41.041 --> 01:05:44.210
They loved the house.

351
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:48.214
It's okay.  Don't worry

352
01:05:48.214 --> 01:05:52.218
Can you come to my house in a couple days?

353
01:05:53.453 --> 01:05:56.222
What for?
